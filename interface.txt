ADD INTERFACE
sudo ip addr add 10.8.0.1/24 dev tun0
sudo ip link set dev tun0 up



üîå 1. UDP Communication Settings
‚úÖ Common Between sender.py and receiver.py
Parameter	Value	Usage
DEST_IP	127.0.0.1	Loopback IP for local testing
DEST_PORT	9090	UDP destination port (receiver listens)
SRC_PORT	1234	Optional (used in Scapy test tool)

üåê 2. TUN Interface Configuration
TUN interfaces simulate a network device that sends/receives raw IP packets.

Each process (sender or receiver) creates and works with its own TUN interface.

‚úÖ In sender.py
Interface	Default Name	Assigned IP (example)	Notes
tun0	via create_tun_interface()	10.8.0.1	Used to read raw IP packets, encrypt and send them

‚úÖ In receiver.py
Interface	Default Name	Assigned IP (example)	Notes
tun1	via create_tun_interface()	10.8.0.2	Used to write decrypted IP packets

You can manually assign IPs using these terminal commands (for testing):
SET ROUTE
sudo ip route add 10.8.0.2 dev tun0


# On sender side
sudo ip addr add 10.8.0.1/24 dev tun0
sudo ip link set dev tun0 up
DELETE INTERFACE
sudo ip link set tun0 down
sudo ip addr del 10.8.0.1/24 dev tun0

# On receiver side
sudo ip addr add 10.8.0.2/24 dev tun1
sudo ip link set dev tun1 up
DELETE INTERFACE
sudo ip link set tun1 down
sudo ip addr del 10.8.0.2/24 dev tun1

These IPs are only for internal routing of your tunnel, not external internet access.

üîç 3. Face Key Generation & Auth
Component	Value/Path	Notes
face.jpg	Face image file	Used to generate AES key on sender side
live_image.jpg	Live captured webcam image	Used to verify and regenerate key on receiver side

‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous
Item	Value	Purpose
AES Key Length	256-bit (32 bytes)	Used for AES-GCM encryption
Nonce Length	16 bytes	Used to initialize AES-GCM
Max Packet Size	2048 bytes	Read/write size from TUN/UDP
